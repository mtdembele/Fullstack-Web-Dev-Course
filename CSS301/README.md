# CSS301: Responsive Web Design
The aim of this project was to create a responsive web page that changes based on the viewport width. I decided to use Flexbox because I
discovered that I really don't like Grid and much prefer Flexbox. This page at normal state shows a header, sidebar, and content box. When the width falls below 777px 
the content box moves onto its own line. Under 450px the sidebar dissapears.
