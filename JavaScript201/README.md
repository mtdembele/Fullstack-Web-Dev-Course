# JS201: Intermediate Level JavaScript
The aim of this project was to create an app that would fetch and display the information of a random Pokemon upon a button click. This app uses vanilla JS and I am using PokeApi.

Functional: I will continue with the course and debug and style as I get the chance.

TODO: Figure out how to add image from API fetch, why typeerror is throw on first click, complete styling
