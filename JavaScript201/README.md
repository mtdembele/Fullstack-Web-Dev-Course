# JS201: Intermediate Level JavaScript
The aim of this project was to create an app that would fetch and display the information of a random Pokemon upon a button click. This app uses vanilla JS and I am using PokeApi. <br> [Video Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d4exyjS2Ibh8AvyAt4_wv4aIL8voh7u3?usp=sharing)

Functional: I will continue with the course and debug and style as I get the chance.

TODO: Figure out how to add image from API fetch, why typeerror is throw on first click, complete styling move script and style to separate files
